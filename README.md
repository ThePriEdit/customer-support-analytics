🔍 Key Insights
1. Billing is the biggest problem area
   Billing-related tickets are the most frequent and also take the longest to handle.
   This indicates:
     #Customer confusion around billing
     #Possible system/process inefficiencies
     #Need for improved agent training or self-service content

2. Phone support delivers the highest CSAT
   Among all channels, Phone has the best customer satisfaction.
   This suggests customers prefer:
    #Faster resolution
    #Human interaction
    #Real-time support

3. Billing issues have the highest handling time
   This reinforces Billing as the primary operational challenge.

4. August 2024 saw the highest ticket volume
   Seasonal/operational spikes should be considered for:
    #Workforce planning
    #Staffing levels
    #Load balancing

6. Escalation rate is high (36%)
   This indicates:
     #First-contact resolution is low
     #Agents may lack decision-making authority
     #Processes need improvement
